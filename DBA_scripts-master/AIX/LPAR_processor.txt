Definitions

A virtual processor is a unit of a virtual processor resource that is allocated to a partition or
virtual machine. PowerVM hypervisor can map a whole physical processor core, or it can
create a time slice of a physical processor core.

Entitlement is the capacity that an SPLPAR is ensured to get its share from the shared pool.
Uncapped mode allows a partition to receive excess cycles when there are free (unused)
cycles in the system.

An SPLPAR has two virtual
processors. This means that the
assigned processing units must be
somewhere between 0.2 and 2. The
maximum processing units that the
SPLPAR can utilize is two.


- VP should not exceed shared pool capacity
The number of virtual processors in each LPAR in the system ought not to exceed the number
of cores available in the system (central electronic complex (CEC)/framework). Or, if the
partition is defined to run in a specific virtual shared processor pool, the number of virtual
processors ought not to exceed the maximum that is defined for the specific virtual shared
processor pool. Having more virtual processors that are configured than can be running at a
single point in time does not provide any additional performance benefit and can cause more
context switches of the virtual processors, which reduces performance.


- Sum Entintlement close to processor pool capacity, but cannot exceed it

Entitlement also determines the number of SPLPARs that can be configured for a shared
processor pool. The sum of the entitlement of all the SPLPARs cannot exceed the number of
physical cores that are configured in a shared pool.

	At the same time, keeping entitlement low when there is capacity in the shared pool is not
always a preferred practice. Unless the partitions are frequently idle, or there is a plan to add
more partitions, the preferred practice is that the sum of the entitlement of all the SPLPARs
configured is close to the capacity in the shared pool. Entitlement cycles are guaranteed, so
when a partition is using its entitlement cycles, the partition is not preempted; however, a
partition can be preempted when it is dispatched to use excess cycles. Following this
preferred practice allows the hypervisor to optimize the affinity of the partitionâ€™s memory and
processor cores and also reduces unnecessary preemptions of the virtual processors.

- Entitlement should be close to real consumption
	- If undersized hypervisor may dispatch the same core for 2 lpars, which do not fit into that one core
	https://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks/pdfs/sg248171.pdf
	Etitlement also affects the choice of memory and processors that are assigned by the
hypervisor for the partition. The hypervisor uses the entitlement value as a guide to the
amount of CPU that a partition consumes. If the entitlement is undersized, performance can
be adversely affected, for example, if there are four cores per processor chip and two
partitions are consistently consuming about 3.5 processors of CPU capacity. If the partitions
are undersized with four virtual processors and 2.0 entitlement (that is, entitlement is set
below normal usage levels), the hypervisor may allocate both of the partitions on the same
processor chip, as the entitlement of 2.0 allows two partitions to fit into a 4-core processor
chip. If both partitions consistently consume 3.5 processors worth of capacity, the hypervisor
is forced to dispatch some of the virtual processors on chips that do not contain memory that
is associated with the partitions. If the partitions were configured with an entitled capacity of
3.5 instead of 2.0, the hypervisor places each partition on its own processor chip to ensure
that there is sufficient processor capacity for each partition. This improves the locality,
resulting in better performance


- Entitlement should be average and the peak addressed by uncapped capacity
The aggregate entitlement (minimum or wanted processor) capacity of all LPARs in a system
is a factor in the number of LPARs that can be allocated. The minimum entitlement is what is
needed to boot the LPARs; however, the wanted entitlement is what an LPAR gets if there are
enough resources available in the system. The preferred practice for LPAR entitlement is to
match the entitlement capacity to average usage and let the peak be addressed by more
uncapped capacity.
